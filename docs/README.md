# Documentation

## Autogenerated

We use `solidity-docgen` to generate `.md` documentation from doc comments in `.sol` files. You can find autogenerated documentation in `/api`.

Folder structure is the same as in `./contracts`, except from addition of `/templates`.
This folder stores `contract.hbs` templates file, which is responsible for `.md` files structure.

### Extenders

We have implemented an ability to add some custom description to autogenerated documentation via extenders.
Basically, they are a common `.md` files which are directly copied inside generated documentation, right after contract description section.

As we also use `doctoc` to generate table of contents for `.md` files, we put `<!-- DOCTOC SKIP -->` on the first line of each extender, so that TOC is not generated for it.
Otherwise, extender would be copied directly to autogenerated documentation with its TOC, which we do not need.

> NOTE: if you are to modify or create new extenders, make sure they include `<!-- DOCTOC SKIP -->` at the first line.

## Architecture

You can find the description of an architecture of our smart contract system, alongside with some schemas inside `/architecture` folder.

Please keep in mind that we add the information as it is needed, so if this folder lacks the information you need, feel free to contact the developers or open an issue.

## Public

This folder stores publicly available information, such as deployed contract's addresses, etc.

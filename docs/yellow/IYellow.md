    uint256 amount
  ) external
```


##### Args:
| Arg | Type | Description |

|`account` | address | Address to create tokens to.
|`amount` | uint256 | Amount of tokens to create.

#### `burn`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Destroy `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the total supply.

> Require DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to invoke. Require `account` not to be zero address. Require `account` to have at least `amount` tokens.


##### Declaration
```solidity
  function burn(
    address account,
    uint256 amount
  ) external
```


##### Args:
| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`account` | address | Address to destroy tokens from.
|`amount` | uint256 | Amount of tokens to destroy.

#### `dilute`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Increase the maxCap and owned token amount by all accounts.

> Require DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to invoke. Require `newCap` to be bigger than maxCap.


##### Declaration
```solidity
  function dilute(
    uint256 newCap
  ) external

> Require sufficient Yellow token balance.


##### Declaration
```solidity
  function lock(
    uint256 amount
  ) external
```


##### Args:

| --- | --- | --- |
|`amount` | uint256 | of Yellow tokens to be locked.

#### `unlock`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Unlock amount of Yellow tokens for the caller.

> Require sufficient amount of Yellow tokens to be locked.


##### Declaration
```solidity
  function unlock(
    uint256 amount
  ) external
```


##### Args:
| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`amount` | uint256 | of Yellow tokens to be unlocked.

#### `lockedBy`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;

  function lockedBy(
  ) external returns (uint256)
```



##### Returns:

#### `reserveAllocate`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Allocate `amount` of Yellow tokens to `treasuryType` reserve.

> Require TREASURER_ROLE to invoke. Require supplied amount not to exceed Yellow token cap. Token allocation will happen to the address got from the hash supplied inside _balances mapping of Yellow token.


##### Declaration
```solidity
  function reserveAllocate(
    bytes32 treasuryType,
    uint256 amount
  ) external
```


##### Args:
| Arg | Type | Description |

|`amount` | uint256 | of Yellow tokens to allocate.

#### `reserveTransfer`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Transfer `amount` of Yellow tokens from `treasuryType` reserve to the `destination`.

    uint256 amount,
    address destination
  ) external
```


##### Args:
| Arg | Type | Description |

No description

#### Declaration

```solidity
  function _requireValidAddress(
  ) internal
```

### `_checkPayload`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Check that payload data is correct: expire timestamp is due, destination is not zero address, there is no zero allocation amount, implementation address specified is this contract and chain id is indeed this chain's id.

> Check that payload data is correct: expire timestamp is due, destination is not zero address, there is no zero allocation amount, implementation address specified is this contract and chain id is indeed this chain's id.


#### Declaration

```solidity
  function _checkPayload(
    struct IVault.Payload payload
  ) internal
```

#### Args

| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`payload` | struct IVault.Payload | Payload structure, which denotes action to be performed.|

### `_useSignature`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Mark the signature as used by the issuer.

> Mark the signature as used by the issuer.


#### Declaration

```solidity
  function _useSignature(
    address issuer,
    bytes signature
  ) internal
```

#### Args

| Arg | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### `getChainId`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
Return chain id.

> Return chain id.

#### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
|`uint256` | Chain id.

### `setup`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
The setup function sets addresses of the broker and coSigner.

> Require DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to invoke. NOTE: once addresses are set, there is no way to change them if their private key is lost. In such case, vault implementation contract becomes useless and requires an upgrade.


#### Declaration

```solidity
  function setup(
    address brokerAddress,
    address coSignerAddress
  ) external onlyProxy onlyRole

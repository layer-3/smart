## Functions

### `setup`

ðŸ“‹   &nbsp;&nbsp;
The setup function sets addresses of the broker and coSigner.

> Require DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to invoke. NOTE: once addresses are set, there is no way to change them if their private key is lost. In such case, vault implementation contract becomes useless and requires an upgrade.
